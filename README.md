# CLI

Implement methods and components automatically.

# Installation

In this project
```sh
$ npm link
```

In a project to be used
```
$ npm link custom-cli

$ npm run cli
```


# Tips
1. The names of the components should start with uppercase and lower case.
Example: ProfileStructu

2. To get started, use the stateless component and set the method implementation to 0.
3. Be sure to set the / first, then write the continuation of the address.
